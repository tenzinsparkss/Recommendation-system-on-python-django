## What is Recommender system?
* Recommended systems are powerful new technology and it helps users to find items 
which they want to buy. A recommendation system is broadly used to recommend 
products to the end users that are most appropriate.


## What is the Collaborative Filtering Algorithm?
* Collaborative-filtering systems focus on the relationship between users 
and items. The similarity of items is determined by the similarity of the ratings of those 
items by the users who have rated both items. 
There are two types of collaborative 
filtering:
    * User-based, which measures the similarity between target users and other users.
    * Item-based, which measures the similarity between the items that target usersâ€™ rate or 
    interact with and other items.

I have used user based collaborative filtering in this project.
